# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **A partial `style=` dict silently discarded every key you did not pass.**
  `fr.subplots(style={"font_family": ...})` replaced the whole style rather
  than overriding one key, and the keys left out did not fall back to the
  loaded style -- they fell back to literals hardcoded inside
  `apply_style_mm`, which differ from it. So a partial dict produced a third
  configuration that was neither the style nor matplotlib: measured in real
  work (2026-09-02), `axes.labelsize` moved from 7.0 to 8.0, and `style={}`
  reverted the spines too. No warning, no error. A dict is now merged over the
  resolved style, which is what callers were doing by hand with
  `{**fr.SCITEX_STYLE, ...}`; a style OBJECT is complete and still replaces.
- **The standalone editor's chat endpoints returned 500 on every call.** The
  editor runs with no `DATABASES` entry -- Django's dummy backend -- because
  figrecipe stores nothing of its own, but `INSTALLED_APPS` registers
  scitex-app's chat models and the handler registry routes `api/chat/*` to
  views that issue real ORM queries. `GET /api/chat/sessions/` answered
  `500 {"error": "settings.DATABASES is improperly configured. Please supply
  the ENGINE value..."}`, putting a Django settings diagnostic in the browser.
  The handlers now check for a usable database and answer `501` with a message
  about the feature instead: chat history is not available in the standalone
  editor. Only the three SESSION endpoints are gated -- streaming a reply needs
  no database, and `POST /api/chat/stream` returns 200 and streams without one.
  Where a real database is configured -- the hosted editor -- all of them are
  untouched and keep working. Reported by scitex-app from a reading of the
  source; confirmed here by running it.
- **`fr.save` crashed on any figure whose rcParams held a capstyle or joinstyle**
  -- every `seaborn-v0_8-*` style sets one, as does
  `rcParams["lines.solid_capstyle"] = "round"`. matplotlib's `CapStyle` and
  `JoinStyle` subclass `str`, so they passed the "already a primitive" check and
  reached the YAML writer as enum objects: `RepresenterError: cannot represent an
  object: <CapStyle.round: 'round'>`. The png was written before the crash and
  the recipe never was, so the figure was silently left without one.
- **Two recipe gaps that made correct figures fail reproducibility
  validation.** A one-point date series (`ax.plot([np.datetime64(...)], [y])`)
  was recorded as the text `"[np.datetime64('2026-08-08')]"` because the
  recorder promoted lists to arrays only for numeric dtypes; replay then
  failed with "Failed to convert value(s) to axis units" and the figure did
  not reproduce (MSE 284 on a correct figure). Date lists now take the array
  path like any other data. A custom dash pattern `ls=(0, (6, 4))` came back
  from YAML as `[0, [6, 4]]`, which matplotlib rejects, so the line replayed
  solid (MSE 240). Replay now restores the tuple before the call. Both were
  hit in a real document build on 2026-09-02 and had been read as a
  constrained_layout false positive; measured, validation was right and the
  recipes were incomplete.
- **Japanese (and Chinese/Korean) labels no longer render as blank boxes.**
  `font.family` was a single Latin family, which defeats matplotlib's
  per-glyph fallback, so every CJK glyph became tofu (the operator's pie-chart
  report of 2026-09-02). The family is now a LIST -- the requested face first,
  a CJK-capable face appended -- on every path that sets fonts: the global
  style, brand style, per-plot styles, pie/finalize, and the editor's
  re-render (which had kept a bare string and brought the tofu back on
  re-render). The CJK face is found among Linux, macOS and Windows system
  families, or named with `FIGRECIPE_CJK_FONT`; when a figure carries CJK
  text and no CJK face is usable, `save()` warns once, naming the fix.
  Requires `matplotlib>=3.6` (list families fall back per glyph from 3.6).
  Rebuilt from LLEmacs's #367 part 1 with the review fixes; #367's default
  change to `validate_error_level` is deliberately NOT included.
- **Standalone editor answers from a real address when bound to one.**
  `figrecipe gui serve --host 0.0.0.0` bound every interface and then answered
  400 to every non-loopback caller, because `ALLOWED_HOSTS` was a hardcoded
  loopback literal and `"0.0.0.0"` never matches a real interface address in
  a Host header (measured 2026-09-02). The launcher now contributes what the
  bind implies -- loopback: nothing; a concrete address: itself; `0.0.0.0`:
  the hostname plus every interface's IPv4, read from the interfaces
  (`SIOCGIFADDR`), not from name resolution, which inside a container does not
  return the LAN address -- into `SCITEX_ALLOWED_HOSTS` before Django
  configures, and `settings.py` appends that variable to the literal. Never
  widened to `"*"`. The derivation is a verbatim copy of scitex-scholar's
  (PR #137) so the three apps carry one function until it lands in scitex-app.

### Changed
- **`_django/_allowed_hosts.py` imports the bind derivation from scitex-app
  instead of carrying a copy.** The verbatim block landed in scitex-app 0.10.1
  (scitex-app #105) and got its public name, `scitex_app.hosts_to_allow`, in
  0.11.0 (scitex-app #110); figrecipe imports that name, requires
  `scitex-app>=0.11.0`, and keeps only its own wiring (`apply_bound_host`,
  `SCITEX_ALLOWED_HOSTS`). Behaviour is unchanged; the duplication the
  2026-09-02 fixes accepted as temporary is over.
- **Standalone editor: `DEBUG` now defaults OFF.** With the old default of
  `"true"`, `figrecipe gui serve --host 0.0.0.0` answered a request from any
  non-loopback address with Django's technical 400 page -- 70,205 bytes of
  traceback and settings -- to whoever sent it (measured 2026-09-02 against
  0.34.6 from PyPI). The standalone server is the one figrecipe surface that
  faces a network, so the safe value is the default; `DJANGO_DEBUG=true` opts
  back in for development. Django's dev server stops serving `/static/` the
  moment DEBUG is off, so the flip ships with its second half: a standalone-only
  root URLconf (`_django/urls_standalone.py`) that keeps serving the editor's
  own assets. `urls.py`, the module host applications `include()`, is unchanged.

## [0.34.6] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **"Add to canvas" works from an installed wheel — the gallery's recipes now
  ship with the data they reference.** 0.34.5 fixed where the gallery *looks*
  for its templates, so the panel is no longer empty; it did not ship the 57
  CSV/NPZ payloads those 18 recipes load. Every data-backed template therefore
  listed correctly, showed its thumbnail, and then failed on click:
  `_serializer/_load.py` joins each `data:` value onto the recipe directory
  literally (`file_path = base_dir / data_ref`, no globbing anywhere in the load
  path), so a reference with no file behind it is a guaranteed
  `FileNotFoundError`, not a maybe. The payloads are now tracked and packaged
  alongside the recipes, and the `.gitignore` negations are recursive so
  `**/*.csv` and `**/*.npz` cannot swallow the `*_data/` directories again.
- **figrecipe is installable on Windows.** One shipped asset was named
  `stackplot_*ys.csv`. `*` is illegal in an NTFS filename, so a wheel carrying
  it fails during `pip install` *at extraction* — the package would simply not
  install, and no amount of Linux CI would notice. The file is now
  `stackplot_ys.csv` and the recipe's `data:` line points at it. This is a pure
  rename: the `data:` value is written from the path of the file just created
  (`_serializer/_save.py`), and the arg's `name: '*ys'` — which is real varargs
  metadata and is left untouched — is never read when a recipe is replayed.
  No published artifact ever carried the `*`, since develop shipped no data
  files at all; this prevents it from becoming one.

### Added
- Guards for all three failure modes, each observed failing before being
  trusted: every `data:` reference in every shipped recipe must resolve to a
  shipped file; every shipped filename must be portable (no Windows-reserved
  character, control character, or trailing dot/space); and the assertions run
  against the *built wheel and sdist*, not just the source tree. The wheel check
  resolves each recipe's references against the archive's own members — the
  previous "at least one data file is present" form stayed green if 56 of 57
  were dropped.
- `available_categories()` is split out of `handle_gallery_available` so asset
  resolution is testable without a configured Django app registry, and it now
  logs a warning when the assets are missing or resolve to zero templates.
  Filtering everything out is not an error, which is why the original defect
  reached production with a 200 and no log line.

### Changed
- The packaging guard no longer skips itself when no PEP 517 build frontend is
  present. It fails, unless `FIGRECIPE_ALLOW_MISSING_BUILD_FRONTEND=1` says the
  omission is deliberate. These are the only tests that open the real artifact;
  letting them skip made the packaging gate one that could not fail.

## [0.34.5] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **The Template Gallery is populated in an installed deployment instead of
  empty.** Every install rendered "No templates available for this category" in
  every category, because `handle_gallery_available` admitted a template only if
  its recipe yaml existed under `_EXAMPLES_DIR`, and that path was
  `_PKG_ROOT.parents[1] / "examples" / "02_plot_and_reproduce_all_out"` — a
  climb *out* of the package into a directory that is generated example output,
  never committed, and simply absent from site-packages once figrecipe is
  installed. Filtering everything out is not an error, so nothing was logged and
  the gallery just looked like it had nothing to offer. The recipes and their
  thumbnails now ship as package data under
  `src/figrecipe/_django/gallery_templates/`, `_EXAMPLES_DIR` resolves inside
  the package root, and the two `.gitignore` allow-list exceptions the assets
  need are in place so `**/*.png` and `*.yaml` cannot silently drop them again.
- **Code blocks are legible off the author's machine.** `_find_default_theme`
  searched for `zenburn-theme.el` inside a local Emacs install; when it was not
  found — which is the normal case in a container or any other user's
  environment — `faces` came back empty and every token was drawn in the default
  foreground on a light panel: present, and invisible. A built-in
  light-background palette is now the fallback, so a discovered `.el` still wins
  and everyone else gets a coloured block instead of unstyled text. The
  fallback is deliberately light-background: Zenburn's pale yellows are chosen
  to sit on `#3F3F3F`, and washing them onto the light panel that is actually
  drawn is what prompted this.
- **Example figures are publishable again — the png allow-list named dead
  directories.** The `.gitignore` negations after `**/*.png` pointed at
  `examples/01_all_plots_out`, `03_style_anatomy_out`, `05_csv_workflow_out` and
  `06_diagram_out`, none of which survived the example renumbering, so the
  blanket ignore swallowed every example image and the README's figure links
  404ed on GitHub. An allow-list that names nothing does not fail loudly; it
  quietly allows nothing. The entries now name the directories that exist, and
  the concept diagram is committed.

## [0.34.4] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Pie styling no longer blanks ticks irreversibly — the fifth and last
  `set_[xy]ticklabels([])` site.** `apply_pie_axes_visibility` pinned a
  `NullFormatter` on both axes, so any tick an author set after a styled
  `ax.pie()` rendered blank, through any handle, with no way to undo it — the
  same defect class that once shipped a heatmap to review with its frequency
  numbers gone. `set_[xy]ticks([])` alone clears ticks *and* labels, and is
  reversible. Four prior hand-searches each declared the class eradicated and
  each missed a site, so this fix ships with a guard rather than a promise:
  `tests/develop/test_no_null_formatter_traps.py` walks the AST of every
  shipped module and fails the build on the empty-list form. Real labels stay
  legal — categorical axes need them.
- **The CI audit gate now grades the commit under test.** `test_audit.py`
  called `audit_all_for_package("figrecipe")` without `path=`, so the audit
  resolved the package by a `~/proj/<name>` guess and graded whatever tree sat
  there — on the CI runner, a stale checkout. It failed honest PRs over a
  pre-commit hook that had already been deleted, and passed the eight
  violations fixed for 0.34.3 while they were still live. The audit is now
  anchored on the checkout the test file itself lives in, which is
  scitex-dev's prescribed idiom for exactly this trap.

## [0.34.3] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Django-bridge entry now loads `mobile.css` — the hub-embedded editor gets
  the mobile layout.** `src/styles/mobile.css` (stack `.editor-body` vertically
  at ≤768px) was imported only by the standalone entry (`main.tsx`), while the
  bridge entry (`bridge/bridge-init.ts`) — the path scitex-cloud actually mounts
  the editor through — imported every stylesheet *except* it. On the hub a
  390px-wide phone therefore rendered the desktop 3-pane layout: text cut
  mid-word, clipped buttons, the rail overlaying the toolbar. One import line
  puts the existing stylesheet on the path that executes.

## [0.34.1] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **Adopt scitex-ui's native favicon support; drop figrecipe's interim override.**
  figrecipe prototyped a `favicon_href` context var and scitex-ui adopted it as
  the shared contract (scitex-ui#65, released in 0.6.4), where
  `standalone_shell.html` now renders the `<link rel="icon">` itself, in `<head>`.
  figrecipe's own `standalone.html` was still emitting that link from its
  `extra_css` block — written before 0.6.4 existed — which on 0.6.4 produces a
  **duplicate** `<link rel="icon">` rather than the only one (the parent renders
  its copy outside the `extra_css` block, so the override never replaced it).

  Removed the override and raised the `scitex-ui` floor `>=0.1.0` → `>=0.6.4`, so
  the parent template that renders the favicon is guaranteed present. `views.py`
  already passed `favicon_href` in the render context and is unchanged — the tab
  icon still brands per `FIGRECIPE_FAVICON_COLOR`.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **`STX-FM019` missing-caption lint** — a figure with no caption forces the
  reader to reconstruct what they are looking at from the axes alone, and a panel
  with no caption of its own leaves a hole in the assembled caption when panels
  are composed. Flags a scope that **builds** a figure and **saves** it with no
  caption anywhere in that scope.

  Conservative by construction, because the obvious implementation is wrong:
  naively flagging every `save(...)` would fire on `stx.io.save(df, "table.csv")`,
  and a table needs no caption. So a scope is only examined when it builds a
  figure, and only figure-shaped saves count — `savefig(...)`, or `save(fig, ...)`
  whose first argument is *named* like a figure. Any of `caption=`,
  `panel_captions=`, `add_figure_caption(...)` or `add_panel_captions(...)`
  satisfies it. Soft (warning), opt out per call site with
  `# stx-allow: STX-FM019`.

### Changed
- **`_quality/_linter_plugin.py` split** — the rule catalogue (a `Rule` literal per
  rule, which grows every time a rule is added) moved to a new
  `_quality/_linter_rules.py`; the plugin file stays the orchestrator that wires
  rules to checkers. Pure extraction: same rules, same call/axes-hint maps, same
  `get_plugin()` shape, verified against the live plugin surface.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Per-figure-type annotation hints** (`figrecipe.hints_for`) — a small registry
  answering two questions for a given plot type: *where does a comparison line
  go*, and *which statistical methods are conventional for the kind of data this
  plot shows*.

  ```python
  hint = fr.hints_for("scatter")
  hint.geometry        # ComparisonGeometry.INLINE_TEXT — a bracket has nothing to span
  hint.draws_bracket   # False
  hint.methods         # ["Pearson correlation", "Spearman correlation", ...]
  ```

  Deliberately a skeleton: five entries, each added because a real figure needed
  it. It grows an entry at a time as concrete cases turn up and is **not** a
  pre-populated taxonomy of every plot type.

  Two things it is not:
  - It does not **compute**. Values still come from a producer via `StatResult`;
    this only says where to *draw* the comparison and what is conventional.
  - It does not **enforce**. `methods` is a hint for a human, not a whitelist —
    whether a test suits a figure is a judgement about the *data* (paired?
    normal? how many groups?), which the plot type only hints at. `hints_for`
    returns `None` for an unknown type, meaning "the registry has nothing to
    say", never "this figure is wrong". Nothing in figrecipe rejects a
    `StatResult` because of this table.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **A heatmap no longer loses its tick numbers with no way to get them back.**
  The SCITEX style suppresses axis chrome on `imshow` — correct for a picture,
  where ticks are noise, but the same call also draws heatmaps and spectrograms
  whose x/y axes carry physical meaning (time, frequency) and must stay readable.

  The suppression cleared the ticks with `set_xticks([])` **and**
  `set_xticklabels([])`. The second call was not merely redundant: it pinned a
  `NullFormatter` on the axis, so every tick the caller set *afterwards* rendered
  blank. A `ax.set_xticks([0, 0.5, 1.0])` after the `imshow` therefore produced
  tick marks with no numbers — silently, with no warning, and with no way to
  override it. That contradicts the readable-heatmap rule in figrecipe's own
  six-stat doctrine skill, and it violated the no-silent-fallback rule.

  Suppression now clears tick *locations* only, in both the live wrapper
  (`apply_imshow_axes_visibility`) and the replay finaliser
  (`finalize_imshow_axes`), so it stays reversible: a heatmap author who ticks
  the axes after the `imshow` gets those ticks, live and through
  save → reproduce. Found while building `examples/12_six_stat_annotation.py`,
  whose panel C had to route around it.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **`figrecipe.StatResult`** — the display-side port for a completed statistical
  test, and the first half of the six-stat doctrine that is *executable* rather
  than merely documented. 0.31.0 shipped the doctrine and a lint for it, but the
  only way to satisfy it was still to hand-type the mathtext
  (`text=r"$\it{N}$=12, $\it{n}$=340, ..."`) — tedious, easy to typo, and
  impossible to verify, since a forgotten field looks exactly like a complete
  one. `StatResult` builds that string instead:

  ```python
  result = fr.StatResult(
      p_value=welch.pvalue, method="Welch's t-test",
      statistic=welch.statistic, statistic_name="t", dof=welch.df,
      effect_size=d, effect_name="d", ci=(0.85, 1.16),
      n=720, n_subjects=12, n_unit="windows", n_subjects_unit="patients",
  )
  ax.add_stat_annotation(0, 1, stat=result, stars=True)
  ```

  figrecipe DISPLAYS statistics; it never computes them. A producer
  (scitex-stats, scipy, a stored results table) fills the fields — via the
  constructor or `StatResult.from_mapping(result_dict)`, the adapter seam that
  accepts the common key spellings and preserves unrecognised keys in `extras`.
  Neither package imports the other; the only coupling is the field names.

  - `.missing_fields()` names the doctrine fields a result cannot render — the
    check the STX-FM017 lint structurally cannot do, since it only sees literal
    strings and skips f-strings.
  - Rendering an incomplete result **warns** (naming the missing fields) rather
    than silently emitting a partial annotation; `require_complete=False` opts
    out when the rest genuinely lives in the caption.
  - Italic symbols, `N`-vs-`n`, Greek statistics (`chi2` → *χ²*), comma-grouped
    sample sizes, and Welch's fractional dof (`694.053` → `t(694.1)`) are all
    handled, so the conventions are automatic instead of remembered.
  - `stars=True` prepends the significance stars — never as a *substitute* for
    the p-value, which is always rendered alongside them.
- **`examples/12_six_stat_annotation.py`** — worked example; every number in the
  rendered figure is computed, none typed.

### Changed
- `ax.add_stat_annotation(...)` accepts `stat=`, `stars=`, `sep=` and
  `precision=`, and defaults to the new `style="six_stat"` when a `stat` is
  supplied (unchanged `style="stars"` behaviour otherwise). Its recording half
  moved to `_wrappers/_stat_annotation.py::record_stat_annotation`, beside the
  drawing code it wraps; a supplied `StatResult` is resolved to plain text
  before recording, so recipes replay without the producer's result object.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **`comma_format(ax, x=, y=)` / `CommaFormatter`** — thousands-separator tick
  formatter, mirroring the existing `OOMFormatter`/`sci_note` pattern. Exposed
  as `fr.styles.comma_format` and as an `ax.comma_format(...)` method.
- **`ax.stx_annotate_n(x, y, n, ...)`** — sample-size annotation helper. Font
  size comes from the active style, colour defaults to black, and placement
  reuses figrecipe's existing declutter ring-solver + ink-mask renderer for
  overlap avoidance (with a *warned*, never silent, fallback to a fixed offset
  when no clear spot is found).
- **Six-stat annotation doctrine** documented as a new skill leaf
  (`27_six-stat-annotation-doctrine.md`): every statistical annotation carries
  all six of n / CI / method / p / effect / statistic, statistical symbols
  render in italic, and N (subjects) stays distinct from n (windows/trials).
  Every 2D heatmap ships a colorbar with tick labels, a label, and units.
- **Two new soft lint rules** for the above: `STX-FM017` (stats annotation
  missing several of the six required fields) and `STX-FM018` (`imshow` with no
  colorbar in scope). Both are conservative (literal strings only) and honour
  the existing `# stx-allow: STX-<ID>` escape hatch.

### Fixed
- **`/api/files` no longer 500s when a listed file escapes the project root.**
  A symlinked `node_modules/@scitex/ui` made scitex-app's `FileSystemBackend`
  (correctly) raise `ValueError: Path traversal detected`, but the file-tree
  recipe-detection helpers only caught `(OSError, UnicodeDecodeError,
  FileNotFoundError)` — so that one unreadable entry propagated out and took
  down the entire recursive tree. A file the backend refuses to read is now
  simply "not a recipe" and is skipped.
- **`imshow` tick labels survive record → save → load → replay.** Two
  compounding bugs dropped `set_xticks`/`set_xticklabels` on a label-less
  imshow axis: the recorder serialized the caller's raw `range(...)` arg (which
  degraded to the literal string `"range(0, 19)"`), and `finalize_special_plots`
  wiped ticks on any label-less imshow axis with no guard. The recorder now
  reads tick positions back from the live axis, and the finalizer checks for a
  `FixedLocator` before clearing.
- Chat views are imported from scitex-app's **public** `scitex_app.chat` surface
  instead of the private `_chat` module (scitex-app floor raised to `>=0.3.0`).
- CI: the in-SIF scratch `TMPDIR` is now unique per workflow run, so a stale
  directory left by a killed worker can no longer fail the next run's cleanup.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **`auto_tile_layout(aspects, width_mm, height_mm=None, gap_mm=1.0)`** — bin-packs
  panels (keyed only by their true aspect ratio) into a tight row-list `layout`
  ready for `build_tiled_sources`/`fr.compose`. LPT-greedy shelf partition over
  candidate row-counts, scored against a target `height_mm` when given or to
  minimize wasted canvas area otherwise. Panels are never stretched/upscaled —
  `sizes_mm` always preserves each panel's exact input aspect ratio, by
  construction (shares the row-height formula with `build_tiled_sources`, not a
  separate implementation). Exported as `fr.auto_tile_layout`.
- **`gui` command group**: `open`/`serve`/`status`/`stop`, replacing the flat
  `start-gui` command (kept as a hidden deprecated alias for one cycle).
  `serve` runs the editor server in the foreground; `open` auto-serves a
  detached background instance when none is running, then opens the browser;
  `status`/`stop` work from a fresh shell via a tracked PID/port state file.
  `gui` is a DefaultGroup — a bare `figrecipe gui [SOURCE]` still resolves to
  `gui open`, matching the old flat command's ergonomic, alongside the
  explicit subcommands (required for `scitex-plt`, a console-script alias of
  this same CLI, which invokes `gui serve` directly).
- Consumer console-script branding: `scitex-plt`'s GUI now renders its own
  page title ("SciTeX Plot") and a navy favicon, auto-detected from the
  invoked program name (no fork needed for future aliased consumers).

### Fixed
- **`gui` default port changed 5050 → 31296** (figrecipe's reserved slot in
  the corrected scitex-dev per-package GUI port scheme; 5050 collided live
  with scitex-writer, both defaulting there). `gui serve` now binds the
  requested port or fails loud with an actionable message — it never
  silently drifts to the next free port — and refuses to start a second
  instance when one is already tracked running.

## [0.29.26] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Audit conformance for the 0.29.25 coverage-shim regression test.** The
  new `tests/integration/test_subprocess_coverage_shim_guard.py` used the
  `monkeypatch` fixture (forbidden as a mock by PA-306) and had a test
  with no explicit assertion / AAA markers, tripping PA-306/STX-TQ001/
  STX-TQ002 (3.11+ CI) and blocking the 0.29.25 release from publishing.
  Rewritten to avoid mocking entirely: the "coverage not installed"
  condition is now a REAL environment (a subprocess launched with `-S`,
  which skips `site` initialization so no site-packages end up on
  `sys.path`), not a monkeypatched import. (0.29.25's coverage-pth fix
  is included here — 0.29.25 never published.)

## [0.29.25] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Subprocess-coverage `.pth` shim crashed every CLI invocation in venvs without
  `coverage` installed.** `tests/conftest.py::_ensure_subprocess_coverage_shim()`
  writes a `.pth` file that starts coverage tracing in child interpreters. Its
  template had `import os, coverage` at the top level, executed unconditionally
  by `site.py` on *every* interpreter start in that venv — not just test runs.
  Any plain command (e.g. `figrecipe --help`) in a venv where `coverage` wasn't
  installed raised `ModuleNotFoundError` on every invocation, once a prior
  `pytest` run had dropped the shim into site-packages. `coverage` is now
  imported only inside the `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` conditional. Regression
  test: `tests/integration/test_subprocess_coverage_shim_guard.py`.

## [0.29.24] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Audit conformance for the 0.29.23 regression-guard test.** The new
  `test_small_embedded_array_stays_inline_and_validates` had no explicit
  `assert` and combined `# Act / Assert` on one line, tripping the
  STX-TQ001/STX-TQ002 audit rules (3.11+ CI) and blocking the 0.29.23
  release from publishing. Split into separate `# Act` / `# Assert`
  markers with an explicit assertion (no `*-not-reproduced*` divergence
  artifact was written). (0.29.23's serializer fix is included here —
  0.29.23 never published.)

## [0.29.23] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Root-caused the flaky imshow nested/composed round-trip test.** `ax.embed()`
  materializes the source recipe's array data inline (`load_recipe()` sets
  `arg["data"] = arr.tolist()` plus `_source_file`), but the save pipeline
  (`_serializer/_save.py::_process_arrays_for_save` /
  `_process_arrays_with_symlinks`) only ever walked each axes' top-level
  `calls`/`decorations` — never the nested `subpanels` list that
  `ax.embed()`/`ax.inset_axes()` produce. So an embedded source's array data
  (e.g. a 512x512 RGBA `imshow` icon, ~1M scalars) was never re-filed to
  CSV/NPZ; it stayed inline on every save, turning `_convert_numpy_types` +
  `ruamel.yaml.dump` into an O(N) walk over ~1M Python-level scalar nodes —
  a multi-minute, deterministic hang that CI's per-job timeout (or a loaded
  runner) intermittently killed, misread as "flaky." Both serializer
  functions now recurse into `subpanels`; the loader (`_load.py`) resolves
  the same nested file references back into real array data. A missing
  source file now falls back to inline data with a loud warning (was
  previously silent). Re-filing only kicks in above a size floor
  (`_SUBPANEL_FILE_REF_MIN_ELEMENTS = 256`): a smaller sub-panel array stays
  inline, because the reproducer's inset/embed replay path
  (`_reproducer/_replay_insets.py`) resolves a sub-panel's `data` straight
  from the recipe dict rather than through the file-reference loader, so a
  filed reference there isn't (yet) something it understands — filing a
  below-threshold array broke the ordinary small-embed case (a save-time
  reproducibility-validation failure), caught by a regression test before
  shipping. Regression tests: `tests/integration/test_embed_subpanel_data_filing.py`.

## [0.29.21] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Audit conformance for the 0.29.20 panel-label-weight regression test.** The new
  `tests/integration/test_panel_label_weight_style.py` combined `# Arrange / Act`
  on one line, tripping the STX-TQ002 AAA-marker audit rule (which runs only on the
  3.13 CI SIF) and blocking the 0.29.20 release from publishing. Split into separate
  `# Arrange` / `# Act` / `# Assert` markers. (0.29.20's panel-label-weight change is
  included here — 0.29.20 never published.)

## [0.29.20] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- **Panel-label font WEIGHT is now a style-owned field** (`fonts.panel_label_weight`
  in SCITEX, default `bold`), matching how panel-label size (`panel_label_pt`) and
  family are already style-owned — "the style owns the field, not a code default".
  `fig.add_panel_labels()` resolves `fontweight` from the active style when the
  caller passes none, with `'bold'` only the ultimate fallback for styles without
  the field. Rendered output is unchanged (labels already rendered bold); the
  weight is simply now driven by the style rather than a hardcoded literal.

## [0.29.19] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Serializing a figure record no longer destroys its in-memory data** (root
  cause of the flaky imshow nested / compose-of-composed round-trip failure).
  `CallRecord.to_dict()` returned its `args`/`kwargs` **by reference**, and the
  save pipeline (`_process_arrays_for_save`) pops `_array` and rewrites `data`
  on those dicts in place — so the first save mutated the *live* record,
  stripping each arg's `_array`. A second save/compose of the same live record
  then emitted a data reference with no CSV written behind it, and reproduce
  raised `FileNotFoundError: <name>_data/<id>_x.csv` (intermittently on py3.11
  in CI, deterministically for any double-serialize). `to_dict()` now returns a
  shallow-copied snapshot of `args`/`kwargs`, so the save pipeline mutates only
  the snapshot; the `_array` values are shared by reference (not deep-copied, so
  file-based storage is unaffected). Regression tests: `to_dict` non-aliasing
  (recorder) + save-same-figure-twice writes data files both times (serializer).

## [0.29.18] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Color-collision detection (save-time, always-on).** A new perceptual
  color check flags two data series a reader must tell apart (both carrying a
  real legend label) drawn in colors so close they are indistinguishable —
  even when the shapes never geometrically overlap. Per data axes, every pair
  of labelled series is compared in CIELAB space (`ΔE*76`); pairs below a
  conservative just-noticeable threshold (default `ΔE 5.0`) surface through the
  existing `run_overlap_check` save-time warning. Scope guards keep it quiet on
  legitimate figures: only labelled series are compared, same-label series (one
  logical series in parts) are exempt, colormapped scatters (intentional
  gradients) are skipped, and colors are only compared within a single axes
  (cross-panel color reuse is fine). Lives in `figrecipe._quality._color_collision`
  (`detect_color_collisions`, `delta_e76`); `Conflict` gains a `kind` field
  (`"overlap"` | `"color"`).

## [0.29.9] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **Auto panel labels no longer overlap the axes title.** `fr.subplots(...,
  panel_labels=True)` adds the (A)/(B)/(C)/(D) labels at construction time —
  before titles exist — so a fixed `y=1.05` offset landed the label on a title
  set later via `set_xyt`. Labels are now lifted clear of the title at save
  time: a title-aware label sits just above the title (scaled by the title
  height), while an axes with no title keeps the default placement (back-compat),
  and an explicit user `offset` is honored verbatim.
- **`imshow` honors an explicitly-passed `aspect` (e.g. `"auto"`).** The imshow
  styler now distinguishes "caller passed no aspect" (defaults to the style's
  `"equal"`) from an explicit aspect, so `ax.imshow(..., aspect="auto")` is never
  silently coerced back to `"equal"` by the styler. (Note: for a square heatmap
  filling square mm axes, also use a dedicated colorbar axes — e.g.
  `make_axes_locatable(...).append_axes(...)` — so the colorbar doesn't shrink
  the host axes off-square.)
- **Recipe save no longer crashes on numpy-scalar labels/values.** A numpy
  scalar reaching the recipe serializer (most commonly `np.str_` from a
  DataFrame column, but also `np.complex*`, `np.datetime64`, etc.) was handed
  straight to the YAML representer and raised
  `RepresenterError: cannot represent np.str_('…')`. The numpy→native coercion
  now has an `np.generic` catch-all (`.item()`) so any numpy scalar normalises to
  its native Python type before serialization. (Previously only `np.ndarray`/
  `np.integer`/`np.floating`/`np.bool_` were handled.)

## [0.29.8] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **Justified captions no longer stretch sparse lines into huge gaps.** With
  `align="justify"` (the default), a line is now only stretched edge-to-edge
  when its words already fill at least 60% of the available width; a sparser
  line (few words on a wide figure) is left-aligned instead of having its
  inter-word spaces blown up to several times normal. Full lines stay flush
  left-and-right (the caption body matches the panel width), only the sparse and
  last lines ragged-right. Adds test coverage for `align="center"`/`"left"` and
  `position="top"`.
- **Auto panel labels (A)/(B) now render at the correct size and font.**
  `fig.add_panel_labels()` (used by `fr.subplots(..., panel_labels=True)`) read
  the plot-title size (`title_pt`, 8pt) instead of the panel-label convention
  (`panel_label_pt`, 10pt), and inherited a generic `sans-serif` family rather
  than the style's explicitly-resolved family — so the labels came out the wrong
  size and in a different face from the axis labels/ticks. They now use
  `panel_label_pt` (10pt bold in SCITEX) and the same resolved family as the
  body (Arial, or its installed fallback), so labels match the rest of the
  figure.

## [0.29.7] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **In-image captions never overlap the axes anymore.** `add_figure_caption`
  is now ADDITIVE: instead of reserving space by shrinking the axes (the old
  fixed `subplots_adjust(bottom=0.15)` + per-axes `set_position`, which let a
  multi-line caption grow into the x/ylabels on mm-precise figures), it GROWS
  the figure by a measured caption band and keeps the axes at their EXACT mm
  size and position. The band height is derived from the wrapped line count and
  font size; the axes are pinned across the figrecipe constrained-layout engine
  so they never move. Applies to single figures **and** composed figures
  (`fr.compose(caption=...)`), whose per-panel `(A)/(B)` labels are re-placed
  against the post-band panel positions.

### Added
- **Justified in-image captions.** `add_figure_caption(..., align=...)` accepts
  `"justify"` (default — full-width lines, last line left-aligned), `"center"`,
  and `"left"`, plus a `pad_mm` knob for the band gap. In-image captions are for
  casual researcher communication / reports / grant figures; the manuscript path
  is unchanged (the `.tex` caption sidecar / manuscript mode). The band and
  justified word fragments round-trip faithfully through `save`→`reproduce`.

## [0.29.6] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Machine-readable layout introspection** (`figrecipe.empty_cells`,
  `figrecipe.layout_report`) — the agent-facing foundation for tight,
  empty-cell-free page packing. `empty_cells(layout, sources)` returns the blank
  `(row, col)` positions of a grid (fast path); `layout_report(fig)` returns a
  native-float report `{mode, canvas_mm, panels[...mm/frac/aspect],
  empty_regions[maximal blank rectangles], coverage_frac}` with a top-left
  origin. Panels are reported at their measured millimetre sizes so a caller can
  re-plot at 1:1 — figrecipe never stretches a panel to fill space.
- **Compose-time under-fill warning** — composing an under-filled grid now emits
  a `UserWarning` naming the empty cells, so blank page space is caught at build
  time rather than discovered in the PDF.
- **Figure-making skill** (`_skills/figrecipe/26_tight-layout-and-page-filling.md`)
  capturing the tight-layout / page-filling know-how, indexed in `SKILL.md`.

## [0.29.5] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Tick record/replay faithfulness safeguards.** A pre-0.29.3 bug could
  serialize `set_xticks` POSITIONS with a different count than the labels (e.g.
  `[8,16,24]` written as `[0,1]`), so reproducing such a recipe raised
  "FixedLocator locations (N) does not match the number of labels (M)" and the
  axis rendered garbled. Current figrecipe already records ticks faithfully;
  these are guards so it can never silently regress:
  - **Reproduce-side heal**: loading a recipe whose tick positions/labels counts
    diverge now truncates/pins to the common length and WARNS loudly instead of
    hard-failing — legacy recipes render rather than crash.
  - **Record-time fail-loud guard** (`FR-FAITHFUL-TICKS`): a `set_xticks`/
    `set_yticks` op whose serialized positions count != labels count raises at
    save, so a mismatched (unreproducible) recipe is never shipped.
  - Regression tests lock faithful `set_xticks([8,16,24], labels=...)` round-trip.

## [0.29.4] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Caption validation FR-CAP-001: `\footnote` in a caption now errors loud.**
  figrecipe owns captions canonically, so it rejects caption text containing the
  `\footnote` command (and the `\footnotemark`/`\footnotetext` family) — which
  breaks LaTeX in spanning floats (`figure*`): `\caption@ydblarg` "extra }" + a
  runaway `\@xfootnote`. Checked at input (`add_figure_caption`, `compose`
  `caption=`/`panel_captions=`) and at the save/`.tex`-emit output (naming the
  file + which caption/panel). Raises `figrecipe._captions.FootnoteInCaptionError`
  (a `ValueError`). Inline the footnote text into the caption instead. This is
  figrecipe's own independent rule (scitex-writer enforces its own on the
  manuscript-LaTeX side).

## [0.29.3] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Composed figures now carry their source panels' captions forward.**
  `compose()` pulls each source panel's own `record.caption`, prefixes its
  `(A)/(B)/...` label, and assembles them into the composed figure's
  `figure.panel_captions` when the caller passes no explicit `panel_captions`
  (grid mode always; mm/tiled when each source contributes one axes). Closes
  the gap where composed figures silently dropped panel captions — the same
  defect class as the composed-colorbar drop. Caller-supplied `panel_captions`
  still take precedence.
- **Writer-compatible caption-only `.tex` sidecar.** Saving a recipe that
  carries caption text now emits `<stem>.tex` next to the `.png`/`.yaml`,
  derived from the canonical `record.caption` (+ folded per-panel captions).
  It is a bare `\caption{...}\label{fig:<stem>}` fragment with NO
  `\begin{figure}` wrapper, so it `\input`s directly inside a manuscript's own
  float without nesting figure environments. New `format_caption_only_tex()`.
- **Manuscript mode** (`fr.set_manuscript_mode()`, `fr.manuscript_mode()`
  context manager, or `FIGRECIPE_MANUSCRIPT_MODE=1`). When active, captions are
  recorded canonically (`metadata.caption`) and the `.tex` sidecar is still
  emitted, but the caption is NOT drawn onto the canvas — so a manuscript build
  doesn't double-render the caption (baked pixels + LaTeX `\caption`).

## [0.29.2] - 2026-06-25

### Performance
- **`import figrecipe` no longer pays the `.env` walk-up cost up front
  (audit-cli §10).** The eager `scitex_config` import + `load_dotenv(walk_up=True)`
  is deferred to first public-API use: importing `scitex_config` pulls in
  `importlib.metadata`, and the parent-dir `.env` walk does many filesystem stat
  calls that, on a network filesystem (Spartan gpfs), dominate import startup and
  tripped the §10 import-speed audit. A bare `import figrecipe` that never touches
  the public API now performs no `.env` walk; any real use loads it once before
  the first API call. **Behavior note:** `.env` is loaded on first figrecipe API
  use rather than at `import figrecipe` time.

### Note
- Also carries the 0.29.1 colorbar round-trip fix below, which never reached PyPI
  (its release run was blocked by this same §10 audit gate).

## [0.29.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- **Manual `plt.colorbar`/`fig.colorbar` calls now survive the recipe
  round-trip.** Colorbars added via the manual matplotlib API (rather than
  figrecipe's wrappers) were not recorded, so `reproduce` dropped them.
  The recorder now captures these calls and the reproducer replays them,
  keeping the colorbar (and its mappable spec, clim, and axes geometry)
  faithful through record → save → reproduce.

## [0.28.20] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **`tests/integration/test_entry_points.py` PA-307 TQ006 + TQ007.**
  v0.28.19 shipped the entry-point regression-guard test with a
  parametrized body containing a top-level `if`/`else` for the
  `<module>:<attr>` splitting (TQ006) and multiple assertions disguised
  by the same `if` branches (TQ007). v0.28.19 release CI's audit-all
  gate caught it (no broken wheel reached PyPI). Refactor: extract the
  value-splitting into a `_resolve(value)` helper so the test body has
  no `if` and exactly one `assert`. Behaviour unchanged.

## [0.28.19] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Module-rename back-compat via `figrecipe._compat` (operator direct via
  Telegram).** The #141 topical refactor moved four private modules into
  `figrecipe._quality.*`. Per the YAGNI grep the ecosystem had zero
  runtime consumers of the old paths, but the operator asked for uniform
  scitex-compat-style deprecation messaging when *any* code touches a
  moved path. New `figrecipe._compat._module_aliases` registers
  transparent `sys.modules` aliases at the old paths so legacy imports
  still resolve AND emit a single-fire `DeprecationWarning` pointing at
  the new path. No flat shim files at the package root (PS-108b
  threshold unaffected).

  Aliases installed (eagerly, from `figrecipe.__init__`):
  - `figrecipe._validator`              → `figrecipe._quality._validator`
  - `figrecipe._linter_plugin`          → `figrecipe._quality._linter_plugin`
  - `figrecipe._axis_alignment_checker` → `figrecipe._quality._axis_alignment_checker`
  - `figrecipe._axis_range_alignment`   → `figrecipe._quality._axis_range_alignment`

- **Entry-point regression guard (lead msg b4e3dc7e).** New parametrized
  smoke test (`tests/figrecipe/test__entry_points.py`) parses every
  `[project.entry-points.*]` group in `pyproject.toml` and asserts each
  `<module>:<attr>` value resolves to a real importable attribute.
  Catches the "moved module + stale entry-point string + aggregator
  silent-skip" failure class generically — new entry points + future
  moves are covered with zero extra test maintenance.

## [0.28.18] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **`Diagram.render(ax)` recipe-recording silently no-op'd because the
  relative import was one dot too shallow (#144 regression).** The hook
  added in #144 to record a `function="diagram"` `CallRecord` on the
  recording axes used `from .._wrappers._axes_diagram import
  _record_diagram_call`. From `src/figrecipe/_diagram/_diagram/_core.py`,
  `..` resolves to `figrecipe._diagram`, NOT `figrecipe`, so the import
  raised `ImportError` (`figrecipe._diagram._wrappers` doesn't exist).
  The defensive `except Exception` then swallowed it silently, so
  `Diagram.render(ax)` "succeeded" but produced **zero** recipe entries
  — exactly the original #139 symptom this PR was supposed to fix.
  v0.28.15/16/17 all shipped this regression; v0.28.15 was caught by the
  release CI on a *different* import bug, v0.28.16 on a fictional test
  kwarg, and **v0.28.17 was caught by the release CI on THIS bug**
  (`assert 0 == 1` in the recording-hook smoke test). No broken wheel
  ever reached PyPI in any of the three attempts.
  Fix: `from ..._wrappers._axes_diagram` (three dots, hitting
  `figrecipe._wrappers`). Promoted the `ImportError` branch to
  `logger.error` so any future "did this hook actually run" silent
  regression is LOUD — the catch-all `Exception` branch stays so the
  recording never breaks the render itself.

## [0.28.17] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **`tests/figrecipe/_diagram/_diagram/test__core_render_records.py` used
  a fictional `figsize_mm` kwarg on `fr.subplots`.** The #144 / #145 test
  scaffolding copied the API shape from the issue #139 reproduction body
  literally, but `fr.subplots` takes per-axes sizing as
  `axes_width_mm` / `axes_height_mm` — there is no `figsize_mm`
  parameter. v0.28.16's release CI test-matrix surfaced this
  (`AttributeError: Figure.set() got an unexpected keyword argument
  'figsize_mm'`), correctly skipped build/publish/release, so **no
  broken wheel reached PyPI**. Fixed the test helper; behaviour
  unchanged everywhere else.

## [0.28.16] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **`_quality/_validator.py` sibling-relative imports broken by the #141
  topical move.** When `_validator.py` moved from `figrecipe/` into
  `figrecipe/_quality/`, two of its internal lazy imports —
  `from ._reproducer import reproduce` and
  `from ._utils._image_diff import compare_images` — kept the single-dot
  form, so at runtime they resolved to non-existent
  `figrecipe._quality._reproducer` / `figrecipe._quality._utils`. v0.28.15
  shipped this regression and `fr.save(..., validate=True)` raised
  `ModuleNotFoundError` on the validate path (caught by the release CI's
  test-matrix — release publish was skipped, no broken wheel hit PyPI).
  Bump both imports to `from .._reproducer` / `from .._utils._image_diff`
  to point at the actual sibling packages of `figrecipe/`, not of
  `figrecipe/_quality/`. Adds an inline comment so the next move catches
  it. The rename-symbols pass at #141 only rewrote OUTSIDE-pointing
  references; this PR closes the inside-pointing gap.

## [0.28.15] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **`fr.nice_lim(data, lower=0.0, round_to=None)` — tick-friendly axis limit
  helper (closes #140, PR #146).** Snaps an axis limit to a "round" boundary
  above (and optionally below) the data extent so the right (or top) spine
  doesn't get its own tick label. `round_to=None` auto-picks the data's
  order of magnitude. `lower=None` snaps the left edge down to a round
  boundary below `data.min()` (negative-friendly). Edge cases handled:
  empty input, all-NaN, `data.max() == 0`, exact round-boundary `data.max()`
  (lifted one step), `round_to <= 0` raises `ValueError`. Exposed via
  PEP-562 lazy-attr so `import figrecipe as fr; fr.nice_lim(...)` works at
  zero matplotlib-import cost on plain `import figrecipe`.

### Changed
- **`fr.compose()` default `gap_mm=2` (was 5) + panel-label fontsize from
  `SCITEX_STYLE.yaml` (PR #138).** Multi-panel mm-based layouts looked too
  sparse at 5 mm; 2 mm gives the close-pack default users expect. Explicit
  `gap_mm=...` callers unaffected. `_add_panel_labels_{grid,mm}` now read
  `fontsize` from a `_panel_label_fontsize()` helper that consults
  `SCITEX_STYLE.yaml`'s new `panel_label_pt` key (default 10 — Nature-style
  panel label convention).
- **Topical refactor: four quality-gate modules grouped into
  `src/figrecipe/_quality/` (PR #141).** `_axis_alignment_checker`,
  `_axis_range_alignment`, `_linter_plugin`, `_validator` moved under
  `_quality/` per the audit-all `PS-108b` recommendation (flat-file count
  16 → 14, well under threshold). All import paths updated via
  `scitex-dev rename-symbols --regex` (3 passes, 9 files, 11 substitutions,
  0 collisions). Public surface (`figrecipe.fr.*`) unaffected — moved
  modules were private (underscore-prefixed) throughout. Test mirror
  created at `tests/figrecipe/_quality/` (PR #142).

### Fixed
- **`Diagram.render(ax)` now emits a recipe `CallRecord` so
  `fr.save(fig, validate=True)` round-trips cleanly on figures containing
  a `figrecipe.diagram.Diagram` panel (closes #139, PR #144).** Previously,
  the direct-render path bypassed the recipe-recording mechanism that the
  `ax.diagram(...)` wrapper path uses, so the reproducer rendered an empty
  panel where the diagram should be → MSE > 100 → validation raised. Round
  trip is figrecipe's core concept. Single-call high-level recording via
  the existing `_record_diagram_call` helper; the replay side
  (`_reproducer/_replay_diagram.py`) was already in place.
- **Test-quality fix-forwards** for #144 and #146: split combined
  `# Act / Assert` markers and multi-assert tests into AAA-marked
  one-assertion siblings per STX-TQ002 / STX-TQ007 (#145, #147).

## [0.28.14] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **STX-FIG001 `axis-range-alignment` static lint rule** (#136). AST checker that fires when two or more subplots on the same figure carry explicit literal `set_xlim` / `set_ylim` calls with disagreeing tuples — mismatched ranges destroy the visual comparison the subplots are presumably trying to make (scientific-figure standards rule #4). Severity WARNING; opt-out via `# stx-allow: STX-FIG001`. Covers the literal-mismatch case only.
- **`axis_range_alignment` runtime validator** (#137). Fires at savefig time, walks `fig.axes`, groups peers by inferred shared quantity (matching xlabel/ylabel or same gridspec row/col), warns when `get_xlim`/`get_ylim` disagree above tolerance. Honors matplotlib `sharex`/`sharey`, twin axes, and a `fig._figrecipe_allow_axis_mismatch` opt-out sentinel. Default `validate_error_level="warning"` per issue #134 preference. Covers the dominant autoscale-with-different-data case that the static checker provably cannot detect.

## [0.28.9] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **Defensive import of `scitex_dev._branding`** in `_wrappers/_axes_scitex.py`. The branding-registry refactor (a78434c) hard-imported `scitex_dev._branding`, but that module lives only on scitex-dev's develop branch and is not in the PyPI v0.11.16 wheel — CI installed the PyPI version and crashed at import time with `ModuleNotFoundError`, blocking every job. Wrap the import + alias registration in a `try/except ModuleNotFoundError` so figrecipe installs cleanly against any scitex-dev>=0.11.7 while the registry rolls out across the ecosystem. Mirrors socialia's commit 5640a56.
- **Subprocess test PYTHONPATH** in `tests/figrecipe/test__env_runtime_respect.py::test_import_in_subprocess_with_no_dotenv_succeeds`. Explicitly inject `<repo>/src` so the test does not depend on the editable-install `.pth` file resolving correctly under an overridden `HOME`.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Diagram element editor** - Edit box colors, styles, and titles directly in the GUI editor
- **Diagram hitmap** - Pixel-perfect click detection for diagram boxes, containers, and arrows
- **Bullet point support** - BoxSpec now supports bullet styles (circle, dash, arrow)

### Changed
- **Emphasis resolves to explicit colors** - `add_box()`/`add_container()` now store resolved hex colors instead of deferring to render time
- **Complete schematic→diagram rename** - All variable names, function names, and docstrings updated (210 occurrences); example output dirs and sphinx docs renamed
- **Serializer refactored** - `_serializer.py` split into `_serializer/` package
- **Diagram render/IO extraction** - `render_to_file()` moved to `_io.py`, `draw_all_elements()` to `_render.py`

### Fixed
- **Editor color picker** - Shows actual box colors instead of #cccccc fallback
- **Text click in diagram boxes** - Clicking text now activates the Element tab
- **Ruff lint errors** - Fixed F821, E731, F841 across diagram module

## [0.24.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- **Schematic -> Diagram rename** - Complete rename across codebase: examples, docs, wrappers, reproducer
- **Module reorganization** - `_recorder.py` -> `_recorder/` package, `_graph.py` -> `_graph/` package, graphviz/mermaid backends moved into `_diagram/`
- **HPC test infrastructure** - Async sbatch support with `--watch`/`--poll`/`--result` modes
